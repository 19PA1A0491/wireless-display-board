WIRE LESS NOTICE BOARD
Communication devices such as mobile handsets and related wireless innovations have become ubiquitous/common. Multiple domains in the field of Communication and Embedded devices are being increasingly explored. The use of cell phones has rapidly increased now a days. Developments in communication technologies have lead to the growth of dense networks. As a means of communication, notice boards are widely trendy with its applications ranging from schools, colleges, hospitals to major organizations. Notice boards effectively tackle the global problem of deforestation by conveying messages at large without the use of paper. Such innovative measures will go a long way in adapting the damage to the environment. GSM technology aims in reducing the complexity for sending a message by incorporating SMS (Short Message Service) technology. This technology can be used in public areas such as hospitals, schools, multiplexes and buildings to improve the security system and also to spread awareness in an emergency. The objective of this paper is to analysis the various proposals and technologies of a SMS controlled wireless display board that may eventually replace with the presently used paper based and programmable notice boards.
